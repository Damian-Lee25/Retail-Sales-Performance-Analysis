Retail Sales Performance Analysis

This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics pipeline designed to transform raw retail sales data into clear, actionable business insights. 
Starting from a simple CSV file, I built a production-ready process using AWS, Snowflake Snowpark, and Python to clean, transform, and analyze sales performance across products, regions, and time periods.
The pipeline automatically loads data, enriches it with derived fields like month and year, and calculates key business metrics—including product revenue rankings, regional sales comparisons, monthly trends, 
AOV, and more. These insights are visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard that highlights top-selling products, seasonal patterns, and high-value markets.

This project demonstrates my ability to design robust data workflows, implement scalable transformation logic, and communicate insights through intuitive visualizations—skills that translate directly 
to real-world data engineering and analytics roles.
